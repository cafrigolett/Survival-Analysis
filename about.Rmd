The dataset contains information about 118 patient with recurrent bladder. To evaluate its effect over recurrence, patients
were subjected to 3 treatments : Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6); Thiotepa and a Placebo control. Along these treatments, the dataset
has 3 categorical variables : size (size of the largest initial tumor); number (number of initial tumors). The survival analysis
compares the three conditions in order to determine examine which treatment leads to later recurrence of bladder cancer.
